# hwak_omp

This is a pseudo-spectral 2D Hasegawa-Wakatani solver, written in python, using [numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) for number crunching. It uses [pyfftw](https://github.com/pyFFTW/pyFFTW) for computing the fast fourier transform, and [h5py](https://github.com/h5py/h5py) for file I/O.
